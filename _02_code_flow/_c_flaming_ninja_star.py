    # TEST   Run the program. Check that your shape is the same as the first
    #        picture in the recipe. This is one arm of the ninja star.

    # COLOR  Change the turtle's pen color so that the flame is a different
    #        color to the rest of the star. Run the program again. Check the
    #        second picture in the recipe.

    # LOOP   When you have one arm looking right, change your for loop to
    #        repeat 25 times.
    
    # call the turtle .done() method
